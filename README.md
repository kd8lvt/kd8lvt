# Heya!

I'm `kd8lvt`, a freelance NodeJS nerd learning Unity and Java through modding some of my favorite games.

# Programming Goals

  * Learn Java and FabricAPI - I have my Fabric repos tagged #java and #fabric
  * Learn Unity through RimWorld and OddRealm modding - They are tagged #unity and #rimworld or #oddrealm
  * Make my own game ðŸ‘€
